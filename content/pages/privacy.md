We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this
privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please [contact us](mailto:contact@lukasbach.com).

Note that, almost all services provided are available as open source. You can inspect the source code of most services that you are
using yourself on [github.com/lukasbach](https://github.com/lukasbach) to get a more technical understanding of how data is handled.
This has no legal meaning, but can help you to better understand and reassure that your information is kept safe.

When you use one of our applications, as the case may be (the "App") and more generally, use any of our services (the "Services", which
include any app, website or service provided by Lukas Bach), we appreciate that you are trusting us with your personal information.
We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information
we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it
is important. If there are any terms in this privacy notice that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our Services immediately.

This privacy notice applies to all information collected through our Services (which, as described above, includes our Apps and Websites),
as well as, any related services, sales, marketing or events.

Please note that the service Yana has a dedicated [privacy policy](https://yana.js.org/privacy) in place, which is unrelated to this one.

Please read this privacy notice carefully as it will help you understand what we do with the information that we collect.






## What Information do we collect?
> Personal information you disclose to us
*In Short:*  We collect personal information that you provide to us.

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, or otherwise when you contact us.

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate our Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our App and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

## Cookie Policy

This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Website to achieve the purposes described below.
Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources
(for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Website.

For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.
For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the
context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only
used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.

Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent in certain countries. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely
withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.

This Website uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a
third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the
Trackers managed by them.
The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the
relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.
In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information
regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information – such as the presence of other Trackers - in the linked privacy
policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.

To find more information dedicated to Californian consumers and their privacy rights, please read the section below regarding california
residents.




## Third-party services that we may share data and cookies with

Some services use cookies from third parties, and share data with those parties. Some countries require you to give consent to allow
us to use cookies. In this case, Data and cookies are only shared if you give your consent. You can at any point withdraw consent that you gave ealier.

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.
Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless
a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). Specific durations
for certain cookies are provided below for respective vendors either in this document or in linked cookie policy documents
of third-party vendors.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information,
or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store
your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### Google Analytics with anonymized IP

Google utilizes the Data collected to track and examine the use of this Website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services.

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
