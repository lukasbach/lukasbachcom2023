You can install it globally by entering <code>npm i -g devsession</code>, so you can\njust invoke <code>devsession</code> at any time.</p>\n<p>You can also install devsession as a dev dependency to your project and create an npm script in your\n<code>package.json</code> with preset CLI arguments to quickly enter a session that fits the projects needs.</p>\n<p>You can use the following arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-p, --port [port]</code>, The port on which to run the server. Defaults to 8020.</li>\n<li><code>-k, --adminkey [key]</code>, This key can be used to register a user as an admin. Defaults to a random string.</li>\n<li><code>-d, --dir [dir]</code>, The project directory. Defaults to the current directory.</li>\n<li><code>-v, --verbose</code>, Log all socket messages for debugging.</li>\n<li><code>-a, --autosave</code>, Duration (in seconds) of periodic auto saving of all open files. 0 = disabled. Defaults to 120.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Building/Contributing</h2>\n<p>The project is set up as a monorepo using Lerna. Note that, prior to doing anything else and\nespecially prior to installing dependencies, you need to run <code>npx lerna link</code> to establish\nsymlinks between the packages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To start developing, run <code>yarn &#x26;&#x26; yarn start</code> in the root directory. This will start\na development server for the backend and the frontend and automatically recompile if\nchanges are detected. The backend starts on port 8020, the frontend on port 3000.\nTo debug, open the frontend from the url:\n<code>http://localhost:3000/?adminkey=adminkey&#x26;backend=http://localhost:8020</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To run a new build, run <code>yarn &#x26;&#x26; yarn build</code>. This will build the common package,\nthe backend, the frontend, the website and the guistarter app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To release a new version, run <code>yarn &#x26;&#x26; yarn pub</code>. This will build everything, bump\nversions for all packages, upload new versions for the packages which are deployed\non npm and commit and push the version bumps. The CI pipeline will pick that up and\nredeploy the website and attach the guistarter binaries with the github release.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Notable third-party frameworks used are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsofts Monaco as editor frontend</li>\n<li>Microsofts Typescript as primary programming language</li>\n<li>Facebooks React for frontend development</li>\n<li>Redux and Palantirs Redoodle for state management</li>\n<li>Palantirs BlueprintJs as UI library</li>\n<li>ExpressJS for the backend</li>\n<li>Socket.io for real-time communication between frontend and backend</li>\n<li>Electron for creating a standalone binary of the GUI starter</li>\n<li>ngrok and localtunnel as built-in port-forwarding service</li>\n<li>Node-pty for running terminals in the backend</li>\n<li>xterm for displaying terminals in the frontend</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...as well as many others.</p>","excerpt":"Open-Source collaborative IDE with many features and extremely quick setup!
