This means that the plugin needs an internet connection to\nwork, and has a dependency on the hosted editor, which is currently available on\n<a href=\"https://embeddable-monaco.lukasbach.com\">https://embeddable-monaco.lukasbach.com</a>.</p>\n<p>I hope to remove this dependency in the future, but this was the easiest way to get the\nplugin to work for now.</p>","excerpt":"The plugin adds a code editor view to Obsidian.
