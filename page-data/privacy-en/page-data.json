The terms used are to be understood as gender-neutral.\n<strong>In Short:</strong> We will provide you with full information about the data we process about you.</p>\n<p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terms. This data protection declaration, however, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. To the extent that it promotes transparency, technical <strong>terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner</strong>, links to further information are provided and <strong>graphics</strong> are used. We thereby inform you in clear and simple language that we only process personal data as part of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible if you make as brief, unclear and legal-technical statements as possible, as are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative and perhaps there is one or two pieces of information that you didn't know before.\nIf you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the legal notice, follow the existing links and look at further information on third-party sites. You can of course also find our contact details in the legal notice.</p>\n<h2>Scope of application</h2>\n<p>This data protection declaration applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data that companies commissioned by us (processors) process. By personal data we mean information within the meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR such as a person's name, email address and postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this data protection declaration includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>\n<li>Social media appearances and email communication</li>\n<li>mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In short:</strong> The data protection declaration applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner within the company via the channels mentioned. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p>\n<h2>Legal basis</h2>\n<p>In the following data protection declaration we provide you with transparent information about the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.\nAs far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course access this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex, the access to the EU -Law, at <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.</p>\n<p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be saving the data you entered on a contact form.</li>\n<li><strong>Contract</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter b GDPR): In order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we conclude a purchase contract with you, we need personal information in advance.</li>\n<li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally obliged to keep invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data.</li>\n<li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we need to process certain data in order to operate our website securely and economically efficiently. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other conditions such as the perception of recordings in the public interest and the exercise of public authority as well as the protection of vital interests generally do not apply to us. If such a legal basis is relevant, it will be shown in the appropriate place.</p>\n<p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <strong>Austria</strong>, this is the Federal Law on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (<strong>Data Protection Act</strong>), or <strong>DSG</strong> for short.</li>\n<li>In <strong>Germany</strong>, the <strong>Federal Data Protection Act</strong>, or <strong>BDSG</strong> for short, applies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p>\n<h2>Contact details of the person responsible</h2>\n<p>If you have any questions about data protection or the processing of personal data, you will find the contact details of the responsible person or body below:</p>\n<p>Lukas Bach\nSt. Johännser Ring 40\n71665 Vaihingen an der Enz\nEmail address: <a href=\"mailto:contact@lukasbach.com\">contact@lukasbach.com</a></p>\n<h2>Storage duration</h2>\n<p>Our general criterion is that we only store personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after the original purpose has ceased, for example for accounting purposes.</p>\n<p>If you wish to have your data deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as quickly as possible and unless there is an obligation to store it.</p>\n<p>We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided we have further information.</p>\n<h2>Rights according to the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>\n<p>In accordance with Articles 13, 14 GDPR, we inform you of the following rights to which you are entitled so that data is processed fairly and transparently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to Article 15 GDPR, you have a right to information as to whether we are processing your data. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data and to know the following information:\n<ul>\n<li>for what purpose we carry out the processing;</li>\n<li>the categories, i.e. the types of data that are processed;</li>\n<li>who receives this data and, if the data is transferred to third countries, how security can be guaranteed;</li>\n<li>how long the data will be stored;</li>\n<li>the existence of the right to rectification, deletion or restriction of processing and the right to object to processing;</li>\n<li>that you can complain to a supervisory authority (links to these authorities can be found below);</li>\n<li>the origin of the data if we did not collect it from you;</li>\n<li>whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated in order to create a personal profile for you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>According to Article 16 GDPR, you have the right to rectification of data, which means that we must correct data if you find errors.</li>\n<li>According to Article 17 GDPR, you have the right to deletion (“right to be forgotten”), which specifically means that you can request the deletion of your data.</li>\n<li>According to Article 18 GDPR, you have the right to restrict processing, which means that we are only allowed to store the data but not use it any further.</li>\n<li>According to Article 20 GDPR, you have the right to data portability, which means that upon request we will provide you with your data in a common format.</li>\n<li>According to Article 21 GDPR, you have a right to object, which, once enforced, will result in a change to the processing.\n<ul>\n<li>If the processing of your data is based on Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter e (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will then check as quickly as possible whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li>\n<li>If data is used to conduct direct advertising, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for direct marketing.</li>\n<li>If data is used to carry out profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We are then no longer allowed to use your data for profiling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>According to Article 22 GDPR, you may have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (e.g. profiling).</li>\n<li>According to Article 77 GDPR, you have the right to complain. This means that you can complain to the data protection authority at any time if you believe that the processing of personal data violates the GDPR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In short:</strong> You have rights - do not hesitate to contact the responsible body listed above!</p>\n<p>If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. For Austria, this is the data protection authority, whose website you can find at <a href=\"https://www.dsb.gv.at/?tid=322736824\">https://www.dsb.gv.at/</a>. In Germany there is a data protection officer for each federal state. For further information, you can contact the <a href=\"https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html\">Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI)</a>. The following local data protection authority is responsible for our company:</p>\n<h2>Baden-Württemberg data protection authority</h2>\n<p><strong>State Commissioner for Data Protection:</strong> Prof. Dr. Tobias Keber\n<strong>Address:</strong> Lautenschlagerstraße 20, 70173 Stuttgart\n<strong>Telephone number:</strong> 07 11/61 55 41-0\n<strong>Email address:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:poststelle@lfdi.bwl.de\">poststelle@lfdi.bwl.de</a>\n<strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.datenschutz.de/?tid=322736824\">https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.datenschutz.de/</a></p>\n<h2>Data transfer to third countries</h2>\n<p>We only transfer or process data to countries outside the scope of the GDPR (third countries) if you consent to this processing or there is other legal permission. This applies in particular if the processing is required by law or necessary to fulfill a contractual relationship and in any case only to the extent that this is generally permitted. In most cases, your consent is the most important reason why we have data processed in third countries. Processing personal data in third countries such as the USA, where many software manufacturers provide services and have their server locations, may mean that personal data is processed and stored in unexpected ways.</p>\n<p>We expressly point out that, in the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently only an adequate level of protection for data transfer to the USA if a US company that processes personal data of EU citizens in the USA is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Frameworks is. More information can be found at: <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en\">https://commission.europa.eu/document/fa09cbad-dd7d-4684-ae60-be03fcb0fddf_en</a></p>\n<p>Data processing by US services that are not active participants in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework may result in data not being processed and stored anonymously. Furthermore, US government authorities may have access to individual data. It can also happen that collected data is linked to data from other services from the same provider, provided you have a corresponding user account. If possible, we try to use server locations within the EU, if this is offered.\nWe will inform you in more detail about data transfer to third countries in the appropriate places in this data protection declaration, if this applies.</p>\n<h2>Security of data processing</h2>\n<p>To protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organizational measures. Where possible, we encrypt or pseudonymize personal data. In doing so, we make it as difficult as possible for third parties to infer personal information from our data.</p>\n<p>Art. 25 GDPR speaks here of “data protection through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings” and means that one always thinks about security and the corresponding security when it comes to both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to the server room). takes measures. Below we will go into specific measures if necessary.</p>\n<h2>TLS encryption with https</h2>\n<p>TLS, encryption and https sound very technical and they are. We use HTTPS (the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure stands for “secure hypertext transfer protocol”) to transmit data on the Internet in a secure manner.\nThis means that the complete transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured - no one can “eavesdrop”.</p>\n<p>We have thus introduced an additional security layer and comply with data protection through technical design (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&#x26;from=DE&#x26;tid=322736824\">Article 25 Paragraph 1 GDPR</a>). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission over the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data.\nYou can recognize the use of this data transfer protection by the small lock symbol at the top left of the browser, to the left of the internet address (e.g. examplepage.de) and the use of the https scheme (instead of http) as part of our internet address.\nIf you would like to know more about encryption, we recommend searching Google for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki” to get good links to further information.</p>\n<h2>Cookies</h2>\n<p><strong>Cookies Summary</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Affected persons: visitors to the website</p>\n<p>Purpose: depending on the respective cookie. You can find more details about this below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.</p>\n<p>Processed data: Depending on the cookie used. You can find more details about this below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.</p>\n<p>Storage period: depending on the respective cookie, can vary from hours to years</p>\n<p>Legal basis: Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 Para. 1 lit.f GDPR (legitimate interests)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What are cookies?</h2>\n<p>Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data.\nBelow we explain what cookies are and why they are used so that you can better understand the following privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Whenever you surf the Internet, you use a browser. Well-known browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>\n<p>One thing cannot be denied: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. To be more precise, they are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other areas of application. HTTP cookies are small files that our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically stored in the cookie folder, the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.</p>\n<p>Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal page settings. When you visit our site again, your browser sends the “user-related” information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are used to. In some browsers each cookie has its own file, in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>\n<p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually because each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other “malicious” things. Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.</p>\n<p>For example, cookie data might look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Name:</strong> <code>_ga</code></li>\n<li><strong>Value:</strong> <code>GA1.2.1326744211.152322736824-9</code></li>\n<li><strong>Use:</strong> Distinguish between website visitors</li>\n<li><strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A browser should be able to support these minimum sizes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>\n<li>At least 50 cookies per domain</li>\n<li>At least 3000 cookies in total</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What types of cookies are there?</h3>\n<p>The question of which cookies we use in particular depends on the services used and is clarified in the following sections of the data protection declaration. At this point we would like to briefly discuss the different types of HTTP cookies.</p>\n<p>Man kann 4 Arten von Cookies unterscheiden:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unerlässliche Cookies\n<ul>\n<li>Diese Cookies sind nötig, um grundlegende Funktionen der Website sicherzustellen. Zum Beispiel braucht es diese Cookies, wenn ein User ein Produkt in den Warenkorb legt, dann auf anderen Seiten weitersurft und später erst zur Kasse geht. Durch diese Cookies wird der Warenkorb nicht gelöscht, selbst wenn der User sein Browserfenster schließt.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Zweckmäßige Cookies\n<ul>\n<li>Diese Cookies sammeln Infos über das Userverhalten und ob der User etwaige Fehlermeldungen bekommt. Zudem werden mithilfe dieser Cookies auch die Ladezeit und das Verhalten der Website bei verschiedenen Browsern gemessen.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Zielorientierte Cookies\n<ul>\n<li>Diese Cookies sorgen für eine bessere Nutzerfreundlichkeit. Beispielsweise werden eingegebene Standorte, Schriftgrößen oder Formulardaten gespeichert.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Werbe-Cookies\n<ul>\n<li>Diese Cookies werden auch Targeting-Cookies genannt. Sie dienen dazu dem User individuell angepasste Werbung zu liefern. Das kann sehr praktisch, aber auch sehr nervig sein.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sofern Cookies verwendet werden, werden Sie üblicherweise beim erstmaligen Besuch einer Website gefragt, welche dieser Cookiearten Sie zulassen möchten. Und natürlich wird diese Entscheidung auch in einem Cookie gespeichert.</p>\n<p>Wenn Sie mehr über Cookies wissen möchten und technische Dokumentationen nicht scheuen, empfehlen wir <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265\">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265</a>, dem Request for Comments der Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) namens “HTTP State Management Mechanism”.](&#x3C;There are 4 types of cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essential cookies\n<ul>\n<li>These cookies are necessary to ensure basic functions of the website. For example, these cookies are needed when a user puts a product in the shopping cart, then continues surfing on other pages and only later checks out. These cookies do not delete the shopping cart, even if the user closes their browser window.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Purpose cookies\n<ul>\n<li>These cookies collect information about user behavior and whether the user receives any error messages. These cookies are also used to measure the loading time and behavior of the website on different browsers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Targeting cookies\n<ul>\n<li>These cookies ensure better user experience. For example, entered locations, font sizes or form data are saved.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Advertising cookies\n<ul>\n<li>These cookies are also called targeting cookies. They serve to provide the user with individually tailored advertising. This can be very practical, but also very annoying.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If cookies are used, you will usually be asked when you first visit a website which of these types of cookies you would like to allow. And of course this decision is also saved in a cookie.</p>\n<p>If you would like to know more about cookies and are not afraid of technical documentation, we recommend <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265\">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called “HTTP State Management Mechanism”.)</p>\n<h3>Purpose of processing via cookies</h3>\n<p>The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. You can find more details about this below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.</p>\n<h3>Which data is processed?</h3>\n<p>Cookies are little helpers for many different tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generalize which data is stored in cookies, but we will inform you about the data processed or stored in the following data protection declaration.</p>\n<h3>Storage period of cookies</h3>\n<p>The storage period depends on the respective cookie and is further specified below. Some cookies are deleted after less than an hour, others can remain on a computer for several years.</p>\n<p>You also have an influence on the storage period. You can delete all cookies manually at any time via your browser (see also “Right to object” below). Furthermore, cookies that are based on consent will be deleted at the latest after you revoke your consent, although the legality of storage remains unaffected until then.</p>\n<h3>Right to object – how can I delete cookies?</h3>\n<p>You decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies come from, you always have the option of deleting cookies, deactivating them or only partially allowing them. For example, you can block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.</p>\n<p>If you would like to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, if you want to change or delete cookie settings, you can do this in your browser settings:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=322736824\">Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/de-at/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=322736824\">Safari: Managing cookies and site data with Safari</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/cookies-und-website-daten-in-firefox-loschen?tid=322736824\">Firefox: Delete cookies to remove data that websites have placed on your computer</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/l%C3%B6schen-und-verwalten-von-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d?tid=322736824\">Internet Explorer: Deleting and managing cookies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/microsoft-edge/cookies-in-microsoft-edge-l%C3%B6schen-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09?tid=322736824\">Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies</a></p>\n<p>If you generally do not want cookies, you can set your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. This means you can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow the cookie or not. The procedure varies depending on the browser. The best thing to do is to search for the instructions in Google using the search term “delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” in the case of a Chrome browser.</p>\n<h3>Legal basis</h3>\n<p>The so-called “Cookie Guidelines” have existed since 2009. This states that the storage of cookies requires your <strong>consent</strong> (Article 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR) from you. However, there are still very different reactions to these guidelines within the EU countries. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 165 Paragraph 3 of the Telecommunications Act (2021). In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this directive was largely implemented in Section 15 Paragraph 3 of the Telemedia Act (TMG).</p>\n<p>For absolutely necessary cookies, even if consent is not given, there are <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to provide website visitors with a pleasant user experience and certain cookies are often absolutely necessary for this.</p>\n<p>If non-essential cookies are used, this will only happen with your consent. The legal basis in this respect is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a GDPR.</p>\n<p>In the following sections you will be informed in more detail about the use of cookies if the software used uses cookies.</p>\n<h2>Customer data</h2>\n<p><strong>Customer Data Summary</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Affected: Customers or business and contractual partners</p>\n<p>Purpose: Provision of the contractually or pre-contractually agreed services including associated communication</p>\n<p>Processed data: name, address, contact details, email address, telephone number, payment information (such as invoices and bank details), contract data (such as term and subject matter of the contract), IP address, order data</p>\n<p>Storage period: the data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required to fulfill our business purposes and there is no legal obligation to retain it.</p>\n<p>Legal basis: Legitimate interest (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR), contract (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>What is customer data?</h3>\n<p>So that we can offer our service and our contractual services, we also process data from our customers and business partners. This data always includes personal data. Customer data refers to all information that is processed on the basis of a contractual or pre-contractual collaboration in order to be able to provide the services offered. Customer data is all collected information that we collect and process about our customers.</p>\n<h3>Why do we process customer data?</h3>\n<p>There are many reasons why we collect and process customer data. The most important one is that we simply need various data to provide our services. Sometimes your email address is enough, but if you purchase a product or service, we also need data such as name, address, bank details or contract details. We also use the data for marketing and sales optimization so that we can improve our overall service for our customers. Another important point is our customer service, which is always very important to us. We want you to be able to come to us at any time with questions about our offers and for this we need at least your email address.</p>\n<h3>Which data is processed?</h3>\n<p>Exactly which data is stored can only be shown at this point using categories. This always depends on which services you receive from us. In some cases, you simply give us your email address so that we can, for example, contact you or answer your questions. In other cases, you purchase a product or service from us and for this we need significantly more information, such as your contact details, payment details and contract details.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of possible data that we receive and process from you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Surname</li>\n<li>Contact address</li>\n<li>E-mail address</li>\n<li>Phone number</li>\n<li>Birth date</li>\n<li>Payment data (invoices, bank details, payment history etc.)</li>\n<li>Contract data (term, content)</li>\n<li>Usage data (websites visited, access data, etc.)</li>\n<li>Metadata (IP address, device information)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How long is the data stored?</h3>\n<p>As soon as we no longer need the customer data to fulfill our contractual obligations and our purposes and the data is no longer necessary for possible warranty and liability obligations, we delete the corresponding customer data. This is the case, for example, when a business contract ends. After that, the limitation period is usually 3 years, although longer periods are possible in individual cases. Of course, we also adhere to the legal retention requirements. Your customer data will definitely not be passed on to third parties unless you have explicitly given your consent.</p>\n<h3>Legal basis</h3>\n<p>The legal basis for the processing of your data is Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR (contract or pre-contractual measures), Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f GDPR (authorized interests) and in special cases (e.g. medical services) Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a. GDPR (Special Categories Processing).</p>\n<p>In the case of protecting vital interests, data processing takes place in accordance with Article 9 Paragraph 2 lit. c. GDPR. For the purposes of health care, occupational medicine, medical diagnostics, care or treatment in the health or social sector or for the administration of systems and services in the health or social sector, personal data is processed in accordance with Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. H. GDPR. If you voluntarily provide data in the special categories, the processing will take place on the basis of Article 9 Paragraph 2 lit. a. GDPR.</p>\n<h2>Web Analytics Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Web Analytics Privacy Policy Summary</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Affected persons: visitors to the website</p>\n<p>Purpose: Evaluation of visitor information to optimize the website.</p>\n<p>Data processed: Access statistics, which include data such as access locations, device data, access duration and time, navigation behavior, click behavior and IP addresses. You can find more details about this in the web analytics tool used.</p>\n<p>Storage period: depends on the web analytics tool used</p>\n<p>Legal basis: Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>What is Web Analytics?</h3>\n<p>We use software on our website to evaluate the behavior of website visitors, known as web analytics for short. Data is collected, which the respective analytical tool provider (also called tracking tool) stores, manages and processes. The data is used to create analyzes of user behavior on our website and make them available to us as the website operator. In addition, most tools offer various testing options. For example, we can test which offers or content are best received by our visitors. We will show you two different offers for a limited period of time. After the test (so-called A/B test), we know which product or content our website visitors find more interesting. For such test procedures, as well as for other analytics procedures, user profiles can also be created and the data can be stored in cookies.</p>\n<h3>Why do we do web analytics?</h3>\n<p>We have a clear goal in mind with our website: we want to provide the best web offering on the market for our industry. In order to achieve this goal, we want to offer the best and most interesting offer on the one hand and, on the other hand, make sure that you feel completely comfortable on our website. With the help of web analysis tools, we can take a closer look at the behavior of our website visitors and then improve our website accordingly for you and us. For example, we can see how old our visitors are on average, where they come from, when our website is most visited or which content or products are particularly popular. All of this information helps us to optimize the website and thus best adapt it to your needs, interests and wishes.</p>\n<h3>Which data is processed?</h3>\n<p>Of course, exactly which data is stored depends on the analysis tools used. However, it is usually stored, for example, what content you view on our website, what buttons or links you click on, when you access a page, what browser you use, what device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) you use website you visit or what computer system you use.

For the European area, the company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is for everyone Google services responsible. Google Analytics collects data about your actions on our website. Through the combination of different technologies such as cookies, device IDs and login information, you as a user can be identified across different devices. This means your actions can also be analyzed across platforms.</p>\n<p>For example, if you click on a link, this event is stored in a cookie and sent to Google Analytics. The reports we receive from Google Analytics allow us to better tailor our website and service to your needs. Below we will go into more detail about the tracking tool and, above all, inform you about what data is processed and how you can prevent this.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics is a tracking tool that is used to analyze traffic on our website. The basis of these measurements and analyzes is a pseudonymous user identification number. This number does not contain any personal data such as name or address, but is used to assign events to a device. GA4 uses an event-based model that captures detailed information about user interactions such as page views, clicks, scrolling, conversion events. In addition, various machine learning functions have been built into GA4 to better understand user behavior and certain trends. GA4 relies on modeling with the help of machine learning functions. This means that based on the data collected, missing data can also be extrapolated in order to optimize the analysis and also to be able to make forecasts.</p>\n<p>In order for Google Analytics to work, a tracking code is built into the code of our website. When you visit our website, this code records various events that you perform on our website. With GA4's event-based data model, we as website operators can define and track specific events to obtain analysis of user interactions. In addition to general information such as clicks or page views, specific events that are important for our business can also be tracked. Such special events could be, for example, sending a contact form or purchasing a product.</p>\n<p>As soon as you leave our website, this data is sent to the Google Analytics servers and stored there.</p>\n<p>Google processes the data and we receive reports about your user behavior. These may include, among others, the following reports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target group reports: Through target group reports we get to know our users better and know more precisely who is interested in our service.</li>\n<li>Display reports: Display reports make it easier for us to analyze and improve our online advertising.</li>\n<li>Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports give us helpful information about how we can attract more people to our service.</li>\n<li>Behavioral reports: This is where we learn how you interact with our website. We can track the route you take on our site and which links you click on.</li>\n<li>Conversion reports: Conversion is a process in which you carry out a desired action based on a marketing message. For example, when you go from being just a website visitor to a buyer or newsletter subscriber. These reports help us learn more about how our marketing efforts are being received by you. This is how we want to increase our conversion rate.</li>\n<li>Real-time reports: Here we always find out immediately what is happening on our website. For example, we can see how many users are currently reading this text.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the analysis reports mentioned above, Google Analytics 4 also offers the following functions, among others:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Event-based data model: This model captures very specific events that may occur on our website. For example, playing a video, purchasing a product or signing up for our newsletter.</li>\n<li>Advanced analytics features: These features allow us to better understand your behavior on our website or certain general trends. For example, we can segment user groups, carry out comparative analyzes of target groups or track your path on our website.</li>\n<li>Predictive modeling: Based on collected data, machine learning can extrapolate missing data that predicts future events and trends. This can help us develop better marketing strategies.</li>\n<li>Cross-platform analysis: Data collection and analysis are possible from both websites and apps. This gives us the opportunity to analyze user behavior across platforms, provided you have of course consented to data processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?</h3>\n<p>Our goal with this website is clear: we want to offer you the best possible service. The statistics and data from Google Analytics help us achieve this goal.</p>\n<p>The statistically evaluated data shows us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On the one hand, we can optimize our site so that interested people can find it more easily on Google. On the other hand, the data helps us to better understand you as a visitor. We therefore know exactly what we need to improve on our website in order to offer you the best possible service. The data also helps us to carry out our advertising and marketing measures more individually and cost-effectively. After all, it only makes sense to show our products and services to people who are interested in them.</p>\n<h3>What data is stored by Google Analytics?</h3>\n<p>Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID associated with your browser cookie using a tracking code. This is how Google Analytics recognizes you as a new user and you are assigned a user ID. The next time you visit our site, you will be recognized as a “returning” user. All collected data is stored together with this user ID. This makes it possible to evaluate pseudonymous user profiles.</p>\n<p>In order to be able to analyze our website with Google Analytics, a property ID must be inserted into the tracking code. The data is then saved in the corresponding property. The Google Analytics 4 property is the default for every newly created property. Depending on the property used, data is stored for different lengths of time.</p>\n<p>Using identifiers such as cookies, app instance IDs, user IDs or custom event parameters, your interactions are measured across platforms, provided you have consented. Interactions are all types of actions that you take on our website. If you also use other Google systems (such as a Google account), data generated via Google Analytics may be linked to third-party cookies. Google does not pass on Google Analytics data unless we as website operators authorize this. Exceptions may occur if required by law.</p>\n<p>According to Google, Google Analytics 4 does not log or store IP addresses. However, Google uses the IP address data to derive location data and deletes it immediately afterwards. All IP addresses collected from users in the EU are deleted before the data is stored in a data center or on a server.</p>\n<p>Because Google Analytics 4 focuses on event-based data, the tool uses significantly fewer cookies compared to previous versions (like Google Universal Analytics). However, there are some specific cookies used by GA4. These include, for example:</p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <code>_ga</code>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 2.1326744211.152322736824-5\n<strong>Intended Use:</strong> By default, analytics.js uses the _ga cookie to store the user ID. Basically, it is used to distinguish website visitors.\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years</p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <code>_gid</code>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 2.1687193234.152322736824-1\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> The cookie is also used to distinguish website visitors\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 24 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> <code>_gat_gtag_UA_&#x3C;property-id></code>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 1\n<strong>Usage:</strong> Used to reduce request rate. If Google Analytics is provided via Google Tag Manager, this cookie is named <code>_dc_gtm_ &#x3C;property-id></code>.\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 1 minute</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This list cannot claim to be complete, as Google continually changes its choice of cookies. GA4 also aims to improve data protection. Therefore, the tool offers some options for controlling data collection. For example, we can set the storage period ourselves and also control data collection.</p>\n<p>Here we show you an overview of the main types of data collected with Google Analytics:</p>\n<p><strong>Heatmaps:</strong> Google creates so-called heatmaps. Heatmaps show exactly the areas you click on. This gives us information about where you are on our site.</p>\n<p><strong>Session duration:</strong> Google refers to the time that you spend on our site without leaving the site. If you have been inactive for 20 minutes, the session ends automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounce rate</strong> (English bounce rate): A bounce is when you only view one page on our website and then leave our website again.</p>\n<p><strong>Account Creation:</strong> When you create an account or place an order on our website, Google Analytics collects this information.</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> IP addresses are not logged or stored in Google Analytics. However, shortly before the IP address is deleted, derivatives for location data are used.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Technical information may include, but is not limited to, your browser type, internet service provider, or screen resolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Source of origin:</strong> Google Analytics or we are of course also interested in which website or advertising you came to our site from.</p>\n<p>Other data includes contact details, any reviews, playing media (e.g. when you play a video via our site), sharing content via social media or adding it to your favorites. The list does not claim to be complete and only serves as a general guide to data storage by Google Analytics.</p>\n<h3>How long and where is the data stored?</h3>\n<p>Google has their servers spread all over the world. You can read exactly where the Google data centers are located here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=en\">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/</a></p>\n<p>Your data is distributed on different physical storage media. This has the advantage that the data can be accessed more quickly and is better protected against manipulation. Every Google data center has appropriate emergency programs for your data. For example, if Google's hardware fails or natural disasters paralyze servers, the risk of service disruption at Google remains low.</p>\n<p>The retention period of the data depends on the properties used. The storage period is always determined specifically for each individual property. Google Analytics offers us four options for controlling storage duration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 months: this is the shortest storage period.</li>\n<li>14 months: by default, data is stored at GA4 for 14 months.</li>\n<li>26 months: you can also save the data for 26 months.</li>\n<li>Data will not be deleted until we delete it manually</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, there is also the option that data will only be deleted if you no longer visit our website within the period chosen by us. In this case, the retention period will be reset each time you visit our website again within the specified period.</p>\n<p>Once the specified period has expired, the data will be deleted once a month. This retention period applies to your data linked to cookies, user recognition and advertising IDs (e.g. cookies from the DoubleClick domain). Report results are based on aggregated data and are stored independently of user data. Aggregated data is a fusion of individual data into a larger unit.</p>\n<h3>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>\n<p>Under European Union data protection law, you have the right to access, update, delete or restrict your data. You can use the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics JavaScript (analytics.js, gtag.js) to prevent Google Analytics 4 from using your data. You can download and install the browser add-on at <a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. Please note that this add-on only deactivates data collection by Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>If you generally want to deactivate, delete or manage cookies, you will find the relevant links to the relevant instructions for the most popular browsers under the “Cookies” section.</p>\n<h3>Legal basis</h3>\n<p>The use of Google Analytics requires your consent, which we obtained with our cookie popup. According to <strong>Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent)</strong> represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as may occur when collected by web analytics tools.</p>\n<p>In addition to consent, we have a legitimate interest in analyzing the behavior of website visitors and thus improving our offering technically and economically. With the help of Google Analytics, we detect errors on the website, identify attacks and improve profitability. The legal basis for this is <strong>Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>.
